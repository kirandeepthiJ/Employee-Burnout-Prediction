# Employee-Burnout-Prediction
A machine learning project to predict employee burnout based on factors like workload, job satisfaction, and work-life balance

## Project Overview
The Employee Burnout Prediction project aims to predict employee burnout levels using regression techniques. This project utilizes a dataset containing various employee attributes to build a model that forecasts burnout risk.

## Features

### Predictive Model:  
     Uses regression techniques to estimate burnout levels.
### Data Analysis: 
     Involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key factors affecting burnout.
### Visualization: 
     Includes visualizations to interpret model results and data distributions.
### Evaluation: 
     Metrics to evaluate model performance.
     
## Installation

### Clone the Repository
